<br>THE BOOK OF EXPLANATIONS, Chapter 1</p>

<span STYLE="line-height: 10px"><p CLASS="eensy">1. There came one day to Lord Omar, Bull Goose of Limbo, a Messenger of Our Lady who told him of a Sacred Mound wherein was buried an Honest Book.</p>
<p CLASS="eensy">2. And the Angel of Eris bade of the Lord: <span STYLE="font-style: italic">Go ye hence and dig the Truth, that ye may come to know it and, knowing it, spread it and, spreading it, wallow in it and, wallowing in it, lie in it and, lying in the Truth, become a Poet of the Word and a Sayer of Sayings -- an Inspiration to all men and a Scribe to the Gods.</span></p>
<p CLASS="eensy">3. So Omar went forth to the Sacred Mound, which was to the East of Mullah, and thereupon he worked digging in the sand for five days and five nights, but found no book. </p>
<p CLASS="eensy">4. At the end of five days and five nights of digging, it came to pass that Omar was exhausted. So he put his shovel to one side and bedded himself down on the sand, using as a pillow a Golden Chest he had uncovered on the first day of his labors. </p>
<p CLASS="eensy">5. Omar slept. </p>
<p CLASS="eensy">6. On the fifth day of his sleeping, Lord Omar fell into a Trance, and there came to him in the Trance a Dream, and there came to him in the Dream a Messenger of Our Lady who told him of a Sacred Grove wherein was hidden a Golden Chest. </p>
<p CLASS="eensy">7. And the Angel of Eris bade of the Lord: <span STYLE="font-style: italic">Go ye hence and lift the Stash, that ye may come to own it and, owning it, share it and, sharing it, love in it and, loving in it, dwell in it and, dwelling in the Stash, become a Poet of the Word and a Sayer of Sayings - an Inspiration to all men and a Scribe to the Gods.</span> </p>

<p CLASS="eensy">8. But Omar lamented, saying unto the Angel : <span STYLE="font-style: italic">What is this shit, man? What care I for the Word and Sayings? What care I for the Inspiration of all men? Wherein does it profit a man to be a Scribe to the Gods when the Scribes of the Governments do nothing, yet are paid better wages? </span></p>
<p CLASS="eensy">9. And, lo, the Angel waxed in anger and Omar was stricken to the Ground by an Invisible Hand and did not arise for five days and five nights. </p>
<p CLASS="eensy">10. And it came to pass that on the fifth night he dreampt, and in his Dream he had a Vision, and in this Vision there came unto him a Messenger of Our Lady who entrusted to him a Rigoletto cigar box containing many filing cards, some of them in packs with rubber bands around, and upon these cards were sometimes written verses, while upon others nothing was written. </p>
<p CLASS="eensy">11. Thereupon the Angel Commanded to Lord: <span STYLE="font-style: italic">Take ye this Honest Book of Truth to thine bosom and cherish it. Carry it forth into The Land and Lay it before Kings of Nations and Collectors of Garbage. Preach from it unto the Righteous, that they may renounce their ways and repent.</span></p></span>
