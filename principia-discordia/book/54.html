<br>ON NORBERT WEINER, NUCLEAR PHYSICIST</span></p>

<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The second concept Wiener has to establish is that of entropy. Probability is a mathematical concept, coming from statistics. Entropy comes from physics. It is the assertion-- established logically and experimentally-- that the universe, by its nature, is "running down", moving toward a state of inert uniformity devoid of form, matter, hierarchy or differentiation.</p>
<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp That is, in any given situation, less organization, more chaos, is overwhelmingly more probable than tighter organization or more order.</p>
<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The tendency for entropy to increase in isolated systems is expressed in the second law of thermodynamics-- perhaps the most pessimistic and amoral formulation in all human thought.</p>

<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It applies however, to a closed system, to something that is an isolated whole, not just a part. Within such systems there may be parts, which draw their energy from the whole, that are moving at least temporarily, in the opposite direction; in them order is increasing and chaos is diminishing.</p>
<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The whirlpools that swirl in a direction opposed to the main current are called "enclaves". And one of them is life, especially human life, which in a universe moving inexorably towards chaos moves towards increased order.</p>
