5. An Age of Confusion, or an Ancient Age, is
<br>one in which History As We Know It begins to
<br>unfold, in which Whatever Is Coming emerges
<br>in Corporal Form, more or less, and such times are
<br>Ages of Balanced Unbalance, or Unbalanced

<br>Balance.
<br>6. An Age of Bureaucracy is an Imperial Age in
<br>which Things Mature, in which Confusion becomes
<br>entrenched and during which Balanced Balance,
<br>or Stagnation, is attained.
<br>7. An Age of Disorder or an Aftermath is an
<br>Apocalyptic Period of Transition back to Chaos
<br>through the Screen of Oblivion into which the
<br>Age passeth, finally. These are Ages of
<br>Unbalanced Unbalance.
