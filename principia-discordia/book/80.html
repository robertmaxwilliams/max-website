<p CLASS="eensy"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In fact you might still push Vennard's The Federal Reserve Hoax:
"Since the Babylonian Captivity there has existed a determined, behind-the-
scenes under-the-table, atheistic, satanic, anti-Christian force--worshipers 
of Mamon--whose undying purpose is world control through the control of 
Money.  July 1, 1776 (correct that to May 1st, Vennard can't get anything 
right) the Serpent raised its head in the under-ground secret society known 
as the Illuminati, founded by Adam Weishaupt.  There is considerable 
documentary evidence to prove all revolutions, wars, depressions, strikes 
and chaos stem from this source." Etc., etc., you know the stuff.</p>
 <p CLASS="eensy"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The general location of our US HQ, incidentally, has been nearly
exposed; and so we will be moving for the first time this century (what a
drag!).  If you want, you can reveal that it is located deep in the 
labyrinth of sewers beneath Dealy Plaza in Dallas, and is presided over by 
The Dealy Lama.  Inclosed are some plans for several new potential 
locations.  Please review and add any comments you feel pertinent, 
especially regarding the Eristic propensity of the Pentagon site.</p>
 <p CLASS="eensy"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Oh, and we have some good news for you, Sister Mal!  You know that
Zambian cybernetics genius who joined us?  Well, he has secretly co-
ordinated the FBI computers with the Zurich System and our theoriticians are 
in ecstasy over the new information coming out.  Look, if you people out 
there can keep from blowing yourselves up for only two more generations, 
then we will finally have it.  After 20,000 years, Kull's dream will be 
realized!  We can hardly believe it.  But the outcome is certain, given the 
time.  Our grandchildren, Mal!  If civilization makes it through this 
crises, our grandchildren will live in a world of authentic freedom and 
authentic harmony and authentic satisfaction.  I hope I'm alive to see it, 
Mal, success is in our grasp.  Twenty thousand years....!</p>

 <p CLASS="eensy"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ah, I get spaced just thinking about it.  Good luck on the 
Principia. Ewige Blumenkraft! HAIL ERIS.</p>
