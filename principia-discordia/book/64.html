<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At first, the things brought forth by Eris were in a state of chaos and went in every which way, but by the by She began playing with them and ordered some of them just to see what would happen. Some pretty things arose from this play and for the next five zillion years She amused Herself by creating order. And so She grouped some things with others and some groups with others, and big groups with little groups, and all combinations until She had many grand schemes which delighted Her.</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Engrossed in establishing order, She finally one day noticed disorder (previously not apparent because everything was chaos). There were many ways in which chaos was ordered and many ways in which it was not.</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Hah," She thought, "Here shall be a new game."</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And She taught order and disorder to play with each other in contest games, and to take turns amusing each other. She named the side of disorder after Herself, "ERISTIC" because Being is anarchic. And then, in a mood of sympathy for Her lonely sister, She named the other side "ANERISTIC" which flattered Aneris and smoothed the friction a little that was between them.</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now all of this time, Void was somewhat disturbed. It felt unsatisfied for it had created only physical existence and physical non- existence, and had neglected the spiritual. As he contemplated this, a great Quiet was caused and he went into a state of Deep Sleep which lasted for 5 eras. At the end of this ordeal, he begat a brother to Eris and Aneris, that of SPIRITUALITY, who had no name at all.</p>
