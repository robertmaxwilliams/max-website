<p>NONSENSE AS SALVATION</span></p>
<p>The human race will begin solving it's problems on the day that it ceases taking itself so seriously.</p>
<p>To that end, POEE proposes the countergame of NONSENSE AS SALVATION. Salvation from an ugly and barbarous existence that is the result of taking order so seriously and so seriously fearing contrary orders and disorder, that GAMES are taken as more important than LIFE; rather than taking LIFE AS THE ART OF PLAYING GAMES.</p>
<p>To this end, we propose that people develop their innate love for disorder, and play with The Goddess Eris.  And know that it is a joyful play, and that thereby CAN BE REVOKED THE CURSE OF GREYFACE.</p>
<p>If you can master nonsense as well as you have already learned to master sense, then each will expose the other for what it is: absurdity.  From that moment of illumination, one begins to be free regardless of one's surroundings.  One becomes free to play order games and change them at will. One becomes free to play disorder games just for the hell of it.  One becomes free to play neither or both.  And as the master of one's own games, one plays without fear, and therefore without frustration, and therefore with good will in one's soul and love in one's being.</p>
<p>And when humans become free then humankind will be free.
<br>May you be free of The Curse of Greyface.

<br><img SRC="images/Tai.gif" ALIGN="right">May the Goddess put twinkles in your eyes.
<br>May you have the knowledge of a sage,
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and the wisdom of a child.
Hail Eris.</p>
