<p ALIGN="center">THE PARABLE OF THE BITTER TEA</p>

<p ALIGN="center" CLASS="italic">by Rev. Dr. Hypocrates Magoun, P.P.
<br>POEE PRIEST, Okinawa Cabal</p>
<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When Hypoc was through meditating with St. Gulik, he went there into the kitchen where he busied himself with preparing the feast and in his endeavor, he found that there was some old tea in a pan left standing from the night before, when he had in his weakness forgot about its making and had let it sit steeping for 24 hours. It was dark and murky and it was Hypoc's intention to use this old tea by diluting it with water. And again in his weakness, chose without further consideration and plunged into the physical labor of the preparations. It was then when deeply immersed in the pleasure of that trip, he had a sudden loud clear voice in his head saying "it is bitter tea that involves you so." Hypoc heard the voice, but the struggle inside intensified, and the pattern, previously established with the physical laboring and the muscle messages coordinated and unified or perhaps coded, continued to exert their influence and Hypoc succummed to the pressure and he denied the voice.</p>
<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And again he plunged into the physical orgy and completed the task, and Lo as the voice had predicted, the tea was bitter.</p>
