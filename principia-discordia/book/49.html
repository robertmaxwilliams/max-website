<p>GREYFACE</p>
<p>In the year 1166 B.C., a malcontented hunchbrain by the name of Greyface, got it into his head that the universe was as humorless as he, and he began to teach that play was sinful because it contradicted the ways of Serious Order. "Look at all the order around you," he said. And from that, he deluded honest people to believe that reality was a straightjacket affair and not the happy romance as they had known it.</p>
<p>It is not presently understood why people were so gullible at that particular time, for absolutely no one thought to observe all the <span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">disorder</span> around them and conclude just the opposite. But anyway, Greyface and his followers took the game of playing at life more seriously than they took life itself and were known even to destroy other living beings whose ways of life differed from their own.</p>
<p>The unfortunate result of this is that humankind has since been suffering from a psychological and spiritual imbalance. Imbalance causes frustration, and frustration causes fear. And fear makes for a bad trip. Humanity has been on a bad trip for a long time now.</p>

<p>It is called THE CURSE OF GREYFACE.</p>
