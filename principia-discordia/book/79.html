<p CLASS="eensy">Dear Sister Mal-2,</p>

<p CLASS="eensy"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In response to your request for unclassified agitprop to be inserted
in the new edition of PRINCIPIA, hope the following will be of use.  And 
please stop bothering us with your incessant letters!</p>

<p CLASS="eensy"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Episkopos Mordecai, Keeper of the Notary Sojac, informs me that you
are welcome to reveal that our oldest extant records show us to have been
fully established in Atlantis, circa 18,000 B.C., under Kull, the galley 
slave who ascended to the Throne of Valusia.  Revived by Pelias of Koth, 
circa 10,000 B.C.  Possibly it was he who taught the inner-teachings to 
Conan of Cimmeria after Conan became King of Aquilonia.  First brought to 
the western hemisphere by Conan and taught to Mayan priesthood (Conan is 
Quetzlcoatl).  That was 4 Ahua, 8 Cumhu, Mayan date.  Revived by Abdul 
Alhazred in his infamous Al Azif, circa 800 A.D.  (Al Azif translated into 
Latin by Olaus Wormius, 1132 A.D., as The Necronomicon.)  In 1090 A.D. was 
the founding of The Ismaelian Sect (Hashishim) by Hassan i Sabbah, with 
secret teachings based on Alhazred, Pelias and Kull.  Founding of the 
Illuminated Ones of Bavaria, by Adam Weishaupt, on May 1, 1776.  He based it 
on the others.  Weishaupt brought it to the United States during the period 
that he was impersonating George Washington; and it was he who was the Man 
in Black who gave the design for The Great Seal to Jefferson in the garden 
that night.  The Illuminated tradition is now, of course, in the hands of 
The Ancient Illuminated Seers of Bavaria (A.I.S.B.), headquartered here in 
the United States.</p>
 <p CLASS="eensy"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Our teachings are not, need I remind you, available for publication.
No harm, though, in admitting that some of them can be found disguised in
Joyce's Finnegan's Wake, Burroughs Nova Express, the King James translation 
of the Holy Bible (though not the Latin or Hebrew), and The Blue Book.  Not 
to speak of Ben Franklin's private papers (!), but we are still suppressing
those.</p>

 <p CLASS="eensy"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Considering current developments--you know the ones I speak of--it
has been decided to reveal a few more of our front organizations.  Your
publication is timely, so mention that in addition to the old fronts like 
the Masons, the Rothchild Banks, and the Federal Reserve System, we now have
significant control of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (since Hoover 
died last year, but that is still secret), the Students for a Democratic 
Society, the Communist Party USA, the American Anarchist Assn., the Junior 
Chamber of Commerce, the Black Lotus Society, the Republican Party, the John 
Dillinger Die For You Society, and the Camp Fire Girls.  It is still useful 
to continue the sham of the Birchers that we are seeking world domination; 
so do not reveal that political and economic control was generally complete 
several generations ago and that we are just playing with the world for a 
while until civilization advances sufficiently for phase five.</p>
