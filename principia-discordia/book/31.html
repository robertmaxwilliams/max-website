<p>If you like Erisianism as it is presented according to Mal-2, then you may wish to from your own POEE CABAL as a POEE PRIEST and you can go do a bunch of POEE Priestly Things. A "POEE Cabal" is exactly what you think it is. </p>
<p>The High Priest makes no demands on their Priests, though they do rather expect good will of them. The Office of The Polyfounder is point, not to teach. Once in a while, they even listen. </p>
<p CLASS="italic">Should you find that your own revelations of The Goddess become substantially different that the revelations of Mal-2, then perhaps the Goddess has plans for you as an Episkopos, and you might consider creating your own sect from scratch, unhindered. Episkoposes are not competing with each other, and they are all POEE priests anyway (as soon as I locate them). The point is that Episkoposes are developing separate paths to the Erisian mountain top. See the <img SRC="images/CautionInserts.gif" ALIGN="right">section "Discordian Society" </p>

<p> &nbsp </p><p><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">ORDINATION AS A POEE PRIEST</span></p>
<p>There are no particular qualifications for Ordination because if you want to be a POEE Priest then you must undoubtedly qualify. Who could possibly know better than you whether or not you should be Ordained? </p>

<p>An ORDAINED POEE PRIEST or PRIESTESS is defined as "one who holds an Ordination Certificate from the Office of the Polyfounder."</p>
