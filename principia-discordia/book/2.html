Many, who had already heard of the <span style="font-style: italic; letter-spacing: 1px">Principia</span> or seen copies, asked if Shea and I had written it, or if we had copies available. Others wrote to ask if it were real, or just something we had invented the way H.P. Lovecraft invented the <span style="font-style: italic; letter-spacing: 1px">Necronomicon</span>. We answered according to our moods, sometimes telling the truth, sometimes spreading the most Godawful lies and myths we could devise fnord.</p>

She is currently passing among us as a computer specialist, bon vivant and philosopher named Grace Hill. She has also translated several volumes of Etruscan erotic poetry, under another pen-name, and in the 18th Century was the mysterious Man in Black who gave Jefferson the design for the Great Seal of the United States.</p>
<p align="justify"> &nbsp; &nbsp; I have it on good authority that she is one of the most accomplished time-travelers in the galaxy and has visited Earth many times in the past, using such cover-identities as Zeno of Elias, Emperor Norton, Count Cagliostro, Guilliame of Aquaitaine, etc. Whenever I question her about this, she grows very evasive and attempts to persuade me that she is actually just another 20th Century Earthling and that all my ideas about her extraterrestrial and extratemporal origin</p></td></tr>
