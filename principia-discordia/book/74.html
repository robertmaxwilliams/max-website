THIS IS A CHAIN LETTER.</p>

<p>WITHIN THE NEXT FIFTY-FIVE DAYS YOU WILL RECEIVE THIRTY-ELEVEN HUNDRED 
POUNDS OF CHAINS!
<br>In the meantime - plant your seeds.</p>
<p>If a lot of people who receive this letter plant a few seeds and a lot of
people receive this letter, then a lot of seeds will get planted.
Plant your seeds.</p>
<p>In parks.  On lots.  Public flower beds.  In remote places.  At City Hall.
Wherever.  Whenever.  Or start a plantation in your closet (but read up on 
it first for that).  For casual planting, its best to soak them in water for 
a day and plant in a bunch of about 5, about half an inch deep.  Don't worry 
much about the weather, they know when the weather is wrong and will try to 
wait for nature.  Don't soak them if its wintertime.  Seeds are a very 
hearty life form and strongly desire to grow and flourish.  But some of them 
need people's help to get started.  Plant your seeds.</p>
<p>Make a few copies of this letter (5 would be nice) and send them to friends 
of yours.  Try to mail to different cities and states, even different 
countries.  If you would rather not, then please pass this copy on to 
someone and perhaps they would like to.</p>
<p>THERE IS NO TRUTH
to the legend that if you throw away a chain letter then all sorts of
catastrophic, abominable, and outrageous disasters will happen.  Except, of
course, from your seed's point of view.</p>
