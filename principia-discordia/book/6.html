<p>Some excerpts from an Interview with <span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Malaclypse the Younger</span> by <span STYLE="font-style: italic; letter-spacing: 1px">THE GREATER METROPOLITAN YORBA LINDA HERALD-NEWS-SUN-TRIBUNE-JOURNAL-DISPATCH-POST AND SAN FRANCISCO DISCORDIAN SOCIETY CABAL BULLETIN AND INTERGALACTIC REPORT & POPE POOP</span>

<br><center>=================================</center></p>
<p>GREATER POOP: Are you really serious or what?
<br>MAL-2: Sometimes I take humor seriously. Sometimes I take seriousness humorously. Either way it is irrelevant.</p>
<p>GP: Maybe you are just crazy.
<br>M2: Indeed! But do not reject these teaching as false because I am crazy. The reason that I am crazy is because they are true.
<p>GP: Is Eris true?
<br>M2: Everything is true.
<br>GP: Even false things?
<br>M2: Even false things are true.
<br>GP: How can that be?
<br>M2: I don't know man, I didn't do it.</p>

<p>GP: Why do you deal with so many negatives?
<br>M2: To dissolve them.

<br>GP: Will you develop that point?
<br>M2: No.</p>

<p>GP: Is there an essential meaning behind POEE?
<br>M2: There is a Zen Story about a student who asked a Master to explain the meaning of Buddhism. The Master's reply was "Three pounds of flax."
<br>GP: Is that the answer to my question?
<br>M2: No, of course not. That is just illustrative. The answer to your question is FIVE TONS OF FLAX!</p>
