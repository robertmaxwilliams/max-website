<p CLASS="italic"> &nbsp; &nbsp; "Fellows," it said, "why does Pickering's Moon go about in reverse orbit? Fellows, there are nipples on his chests; do he give milk? And what, pray tell, Fellows, is to be done about Heisenberg's Law?" It paused. "SOMEBODY HAD TO PUT ALL OF THIS CONFUSION HERE!"</p>

<p CLASS="italic"> &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that it revealed its scroll. It was a diagram, like a yin- yang with a pentagon on one side and an apple on the other. And then it exploded and the two lost consciousness.</p>
<p CLASS="subheader"><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">ERIS - Goddess of Chaos, Discord & Confusion</span></p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; They awoke to the sound of pins clattering, and found the bowlers engaged in their game and the server busy with making coffee. It was apparant that their experience had been private.</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; They discussed their strange encounter and reconstructed from memory the chimpanzee's diagram. Over the next five days they searched libraries to find the significance of it, but were disappointed to uncover only references to Taoism, the Korean flag, and Technocracy. It was not until they traced the Greek writing on the apple that they discovered the ancient Goddess known to the Greeks as Eris and to the Romans as Discordia. This was on the fifth night, and when they slept that night each had a vivid dream of a splendid woman whose eyes were as soft as feather and as deep as eternity itself, and whose body was the spectacular dance of atoms and universes. Pyrotechnics of pure energy formed her flowing hair, and rainbows manifested and dissolved as she spoke in a warm and gentle voice:</p>

<p CLASS="italic"> &nbsp; &nbsp; I have come to tell you that you are free. Many ages ago, My consciousness left humanity, that they might develop themselves. I return to find this development approaching completion, but hindered by fear and by misunderstanding.</p>
