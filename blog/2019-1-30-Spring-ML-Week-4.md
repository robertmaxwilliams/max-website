# Week 4 Monday 
Monday, Luke and I had a meeting with Dr. Yampolskiy and Dr. Harrison, and each presented one paper.
I presented


# Week 4 Wednesday

Wednesday was a snow day, I don't know what that has to do with this blog but it sounds better that
way.

# Week 4 Friday

On Monday, Dr. Yampolskiy shared a paper with me. It's a bit long (33 pages) but "it's a fun read",
so it should go quickly. 

### The Surprising Creativity of Digital Evolution: 

A Collection of Anecdotes from the Evolutionary Computation and Artificial Life Research Communities
<br>
[https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03453](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03453)

The paper introduces itself as a correction to a trend of interesting evolution results going
unpublished, losing knowledge about biological-like artificial life and cleverness.
