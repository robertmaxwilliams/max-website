title: Thesis Week 7 (Spring)
---

I'm starting on time today! The first full week of *the schedule*. It's not perfect because I slept
in so I'm going to have to break in a second to eat some toast and make some tea. Today I'm drinking
tea from 1 teaspoon oolong tea. It's really old so it might not be effective anymore, I'm not sure
how tea works. I'll see. Anyway I need to get to work. 

Work log:

- Monday: 
    - 10-12:
    - 1-3:


Where was I? I was reading about how the pessimism of NAT and the optimism of HRT are not
contradictory, and can be understood together to make a more complete theory. This is good, because
NAT-based analysis is really disheartening. 

Wow I really need to shave, my face is getting itchy. Okay time to break for toast 5 minutes into
work. 

Okay break took until 10:18, no more procrastinating. 

10:53: work is going well, I'm basically summarizing Shrivastava's NAT-HRT reconciliation arguments
in my related works section. I hope that it's not too redundant, but I do need as many pages of
related works (even at the cost of quality) for this paper to work. 

Off topic idea: Put work into general purpose visualizers for software. Software control is so
dangerous because of how much invisible hidden state and complexity is completely hidden inside
(with only the smallest peeks given by its outputs). There might be some elegant way of depicting
information flow and state through a program which works in general for any software. I guess the
size of real-world programs makes this much more difficult, as you have megabytes of ram doing stuff
at any given point in time, most of which is impossible to understand without a deeper understanding
of the program. I encountered this when trying to visualize neural networks - looking at the weights
and activations as 2d images could only tell you so much, Although it was key to me finding the bug
that was breaking my program. Or maybe it was careful reading of my code that fixed it, and the
visualization stuff only added complexity and wasted time? I don't remember exactly.

TODO: recreate the 2-axis figure with different industries on it as part of my risk assessment, and
show where modern systems lie on it. I love those kinds of plots, even if they are extremely
arbitrary. 

Open systems is a really interesting concept. It replaces what might also be called an "autonomous
agent" or an "embedded agent", and goes to the trouble of understanding the boundary between the
system and environment as "arbitrary, changing, and not physical but mental"

Breaking for lunch. I finished reading the paper but I stopped writing my summary because I was a
bit confused by some parts. I need to figure out what they mean by NAT and HRT working at different
points in time. Figure 2 seems to show that HRT focuses on steady state accidents while NAT focuses
on eventual catastrophe, and also bringing in the degradation theory complicates things further. So
an organization is a block of slices of Swiss cheese, where the holes move around, and they get
bigger and interact in worse ways the more time goes on? And when things go wrong, the system tries
to compensate by increasing coupling, which causes a spike in complexity and cognitive overload
occurs.

I think I have it - the degradation followed by sudden accident is what HRT is concerned with, while
the explosion in apparent complexity is what NAT is concerned with. So I need to retract what I said
about NAT being Swiss-cheese oriented. Ugh.


Also I wrote about 300 words. I need 10,000 more, so if I just do that 33 more times I'll be good.
Each week has 4 days, 2 sessions each (minus one on Thursdays). So 7 sessions per week, 7 weeks, 49
sessions. Hey, that makes this possible with a healthy margin of error! But I really really really
have to stay productive to reach that. Ha, it's like a burn-down chart. A metric! How neat.

Lunch break. 

I started back up at 1 but my mom called me back, so now it's 1:30 and I'm back to work. I was
reading a fundamental work that Shrivastava cited in a footnote, but unless I need to pull in more
nebulous material I'm going to drop it for now. Back to understanding and using Shrivastava's
perspective. 

Actually, according to Shrivastava, this paper has a tier of systems which might be a useful axis
for my classification system.  (15 minutes later) Nah, while the (framework, clockwork, thermostat,
open system) breakdown is very good, the (plant, animal, human, society) levels seems very arbitrary
and human-centric. It seems that at this point he's just restating the common understanding of the
hierarchy of the world that puts humans at the top, to which there is plenty of evidence against
(intelligence of non-humans being abound in the natural world, and failures of so-called general
intelligence of humans being so incredible).

Well. Now I need to read Shrivastava and write a few paragraphs about the reconciliation of NAT and
HRT.

I'm very confused about their notion of entropy. They claim that open systems appear to defy
thermodynamics, which is absolutely untrue as they consume energy. A plant growing and becoming
ordered (and amassing chemical energy) isn't defying anything - it's just using the energy that
rains down from the sky and holding onto longer than would happen otherwise. "Wear and tear" as
entropy is very different from thermodynamic entropy, and conflating the two seems like a mistake
made here. And even more so for social systems. 

Okay, time to introduce DIT into my paper. Oof this is getting complicated

Okay I did that, then got distracted for about 10 minutes because someone sent me a video about
GPT-3. 

Okay done for today. Wow, I wrote almost a thousand words today. Not all of it is good, but that's
what editing is for. Write, write, write, the rest is for the editing stage.

Well that's all for today. Feeling good about writing, and I made some small conceptual progress. I
still need to figure out how to recommend actions based on the classification, and classify more
real world accidents.
