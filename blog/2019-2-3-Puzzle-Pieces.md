title: Puzzle Pieces
---

I am in a room facing a vast board. Scattered on it are thousands of small colorful bits of
cardboard, puzzle pieces. Scattered about are coherent continents, with ragged edges waiting for
more pieces. As long as I have known, I have been idly placing pieces where they fit. I think the
board was blank when I started, or maybe it had a few islands already put there from the beginning.
New pieces show up inconspicuously. I can't remember a single time I noticed the arrival of one, or
have been able to tell which are old and which are new. The pictures they draw make no sense to me,
but I feel like they must be valuable to someone. At first it seemed that whoever was creating these
pieces wanted to know what the picture was. But I suspected that they knew the picture well and
wanted me to assemble it. I grew frustrated in my suspicion and took a piece that fit easily in a
hole that had been unfilled, and conspired to place it anywhere else. I took others back out and, to
my surprise, found them new places to live. I placed the pieces in the least obvious places I could
find. The pictures they drew were still as meaningless, the same noise of patterns and colors and
edges. But now I twisted them instead of them twisting me and they grew familiar. I trusted the
pieces less and less, but still sensed the patterns were vastly important. I never did place
the very first piece which had been refused its rightful place; its place sits vagrant and waits
like an itch to be scratched.
