# Monday

I'm in a weird place, not quite out of the grasp of the school but not yet completely taking part in
what it is that I'm doing this summer. I feel a bit lost, tired. But also I had a very exhausting
weekend: I went backpacking with my friend Greg, the first backpacking I've done in a long time. My
body is tired, and after a bit of remembering what it's like away from the city I find it
increasingly unpleasant and hostile.

Today was about cleaning up. All my stuff from backpacking and a backlog of dishes and such from
preparing for the trip. 

Also, I was up until 2am playing card games (a Nomic variant) with my roommates. We had a lot of
fun, and I shouldn't be so quick to attibute my current lack of mental energy to some broad societal
ill before noticing that I slept restlessly on the dirt one night, and the stayed up very late the
next. There's probably a correlation there.

So in other words, I'm fine. The start of this week isn't such that I can start my work schedule
just yet, but Thursday and Friday are work days. I need to fit in some singing practice today, then
drive to mom's and I won't have any work until Thursday. That's so hard for me to understand, not
having work to do. But I have so much work to do, with all the portfolio building I have planned and
hobbies I have going. I'm going to list them:

- Organize past work (github, etc) into a portfolio, preferably interactive or videos
- NMFM project
- Some other alife project, evolvable grid stuff thing
- Fictional Product Manuals
- Starting my side gig growing gourmet mushrooms for fun and profit
- Taking singing lessons and practicing enough during the week

The first 4 are things I hope to finish this month. 

# Friday

This hasn't been an office work sort of week, but next week and the week after will be, so I can
accompish my software-related goals. Commencement is tommorrow, I think that's as real as it gets
for being done (for now).

Whew, using that paper template was a nightmare. It broke my bibliography, mangles links so they get
forwarded through a broken .gov website, and just looks pretty ugly with its line numbers and huge
margins. What a pain. Not as bad as reformatting a paper in word, though, by a long shot.

I feel really anxious, like there's something I need to do. Commencement tomorrow is stressful, but
it's more than that. Isn't today something important? I think it's because I haven't had a deadline
in a week I feel like I'm probably failing some class. It's weird that this whole summer I don't
have any deadlines.

I finished the submission, and stayed on overtime to learn to use freeCAD. I have a top secret
project that's going to require it.
