title: Communications - persuasive speaking assignment
---

We have to create persuasive speeches on a topic of out choosing, to persuade the audience of a
fact. I think using "the earth is flat" as my fact would be pretty hilarious, especially if well
executed. Now all I need is evidence. Flat earther stuff is best done interactively, with a round
earth constituent pointing out flaws in the idea that the earth is flat, and the flat earther
patching them up with ad hoc hypothesis. I could plant an audience member to ask easy to refute
questions, or discuss them myself. It's better to have to questions seem to come from the domain of
all possible questions, i.e. from a supposedly fair audience member, but lacking that, scripted
responses can be made to seem fair. 

Of course, I would never put the burden of proof in the wrong place. I can't assume the earth is
flat and refute anyone's claim to the contrary. Not at first at least. I need to give a few solid
reasons to believe it is, then test this hypothesis. 

Reasons the earth is flat:

- It looks flat. You don't have to account for any curvature when building a house or planning a
  trip, and you can't see curvature
- Most maps are flat

(supposed) Reasons the Earth is round:

- Globes are used for sea navigation
    + Flat maps are also used, and incorrect globes have existed in the past
- Some people claim it looks round from space
    + How did they measure this? Are they telling the truth?
- Ships are sea disappear bottom first
    + This is due to increasing sea spray obscuring the horizon
- Lunar and solar eclipses?
    + For a short time on specific occasions Rahu swallows the Sun, and Ketu swallows the moon. When it happens, the two celestial beings said to remain in fear, overshadowed by the darkness of the demons, and feel relieved when they finally emerge out of their tails and become free.
- Why does more land become visible as you climb mountains/tree?
    + Because you can see past more local disturbances, like buildings and hills and trees
- How is it day and night in different places? 
    + Good question!
- Sunset?
    + Umm.. how does the sun work??
- Shadows in different places/time of year?
    + Oh, that might be really complicated
- Pictures from space
    + Some think they're doctored, but actually it's because the vacuum of space acts as a lens.

## Introduction

In our culture, we have many metaphors and such about the earth being a ball: "around the world" etc
and even have maps that have been mashed onto a sphere to form a "globe". However, this "Round Earth
Theory" has many flaws that we will discuss and find that it is much simpler to assume the earth is flat.
