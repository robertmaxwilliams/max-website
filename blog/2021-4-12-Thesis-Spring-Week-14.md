# Monday

Well. I missed the morning today. I was at my desk at 9:45, and decided I'd take a 15 minute nap instead of starting
early since I felt a bit sleepy. When I woke up it was almost 12. So, I'll go ahead and have lunch then do the 1-3 shift
today. Here's my TODO list: 

- [x] contact thesis committee members
- [x] pick defense date
- [x] add CV to thesis
- [x] submit application to graduate or something
- [x] find out if I should have my defense in person (I won't, I'll used zoom)
- [ ] make presentation (slides)
- [ ] practice presentation
- [x] send final copy to Dr. Yampolskiy
- [x] distribute copies to thesis committee members (should they be in print?) (YES.)
- [x] Update my website since someone on the committee might check it out from my CV
- [x] figure out when and how commencement will work
- [ ] Make the website that I said I would - I never mentioned this in the thesis! This is fine. I'll do a live demo of
  it, it's only needed because I said I would in my thesis application and such.

## Done list:

- Applied for late apparel
- RSVP'd for commencement
- Failed to apply for degree ("A valid graduation application already exsists for this academic program")
    - Apparently I've already applied
- Invited everyone to commencement
- Sent whenisgood to all thesis committe members 
- Sent whenisgood to the department chair. I assume he's supposed to be there but I did his seperate since
  I'm not completely sure. He's invited either way. Also I told him I was going to deliver a paper copy to him to his
  office and that if he needed it somewhere else (if his office is in a different place or something) that I could do
  that.
- The two committee members also got emails about delivering the paper thesis


# Tuesday

Today I'm going to add my CV to my thesis, which means I need to update it, and finalize my thesis. There is some
wording in the abstract I need to clean up. And a few latex errors. Any typos that remain are just going to be there,
there's no reason to make it 100\% perfect. I know I'm going to print out 6 copies and then notice a typo, but that's
okay. I'll be fine. Everyone's thesis has typos, and I'm confident mine has few enough that they aren't worth noticing.


## Done list

- Got email to pick seats and get tickets for commencement
- Added CV to my thesis
- Cleaned up the abstract
- Got a time and date for my defense: Tuesday, April 20th at 1pm 
- Sent zoom invite to everyone (I even paid for Zoom so it wouldn't be limited to 40 mins... I don't think UofL paid for
  accounts for us.
- Made a few final edits, rearranged some sections to fit the guidelines properly
- Sent "finalized" version to reviewer
- Filled out exam request form and sent it to Dr. Yampolskiy. There's some issue with it supposed to have been turned in
  two weeks before the defense. Oops. We'll so how that goes.


# Friday

Wednesday was an errands day. Thursday I distributed my thesis to everyone on the thesis committee. 

Okay so the slides are basically done, I just need to find a way to cram in suggested measures into the case studies. 20
slides seems a bit small for such a long paper, but I've done a lot of compression and I prefer to have few slides with
a LOT to talk about than a bunch of rapid-fire slides. My goal is to have half of the speaker notes done for today so I
can finish them and start rehearsing tomorrow.

# Saturday

I've been spending all my time on the network security blue team (aka defense) event to pracrastinate working on my
thesis. It's really fun and eductional, though. I even got into one of the other team's databases (they deserved it -
they were scanning our network) and messed with some things. Sadly, their site barely works so the pranks will have to
wait. If I did it right (and I probably didn't) then 1/10 times they load the page it'll redirect to the Rickroll video.
It's like the early internet all over again. Their mysql user doesn't have write access to the website directory, so
they only way forward I know of won't be effective, and all the text fields are too small to fit a more robust rick roll
into :(

I really need to be working on my thesis presentation, though. I've gotten very lazy this week.

Okay instead I went and found I could ssh into their server using the default login and added an autoplay Rick Astley
video... it's not hard to fix or anything, I wonder why they haven't tried to fix it yet. I really hope the Dr. Lauf's
ammusement at a rickroll overpowers his moral obligation to tell us not to hack our classmates. And I **did** fix their
site - there was a small bug that caused all the links and sylesheets to break. So I'm probably a net positive for that
team.

Now I'll get back to work on my presentation.

# Sunday 

So Friday afternoon, I got distracted as the netsec event started. Saturday I spent all day on netsec and barely worked
on the presentation at all. Today I have to - I need Monday to practice presenting. It really isn't that much work it
just takes some creativity.

Okay it's noon and I made it to the classification schema.

Back from lunch, time to finish writing this dang ol' presentation.

It's 3 and I've made a bit of progress. I'm stressed, but in a frustrating avoidant way instead of a focused way. I
could go for a run, but I'm not sure if that would help. I just ate some so I'll work some more before going for a run.

8:20 - Didn't go for that run, but I have gotten a lot done. Dr. Yampolskiy sent me some recommendations on my slides,
and I'm nearly done writing my script for everything except the case studies, and I think it's best to ad-lib those.

It's 9 and I'm calling it good for tonight. I should be able to practice all tomorrow and iron out the details. Also
adding pictures, although trite, was a great idea for the presentation. It makes it better for me, too.
