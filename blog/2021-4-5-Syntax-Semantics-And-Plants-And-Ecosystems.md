title: Syntax & Semantics, Plants & Ecosystems
---

It's been too long since I've been backpacking. So long that I've aquired a number of perspectives
and ideas that I hadn't had in the past that change how I look at the natural world. I finally
understood what Stephen Buhner and Douglas Hoftstadter were raving about when they mentioned syntax
vs. semantics then veered off into apparently unrelated topics like plants and music.
