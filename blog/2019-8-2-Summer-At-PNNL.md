title: Summer at PNNL
---

I spent this summer working for Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. It was a great experience! I
worked with lots of people who do deep learning and data science full time, and, even better, they
use linux and vim and all the programming things that make life as a programmer so much better. So 
much better than the "standard" Windows/C#/Visual Studio stack. Best of all, I feel confident
implementing my own models in PyTorch. 

I am a bit disapointed. The machine learning model I worked on the second half of the summer didn't
really work. It learned, much better than random, but didn't outperform the general purpose baseline
I was comparing it against. It might have been doomed from its inception, or maybe I made poor
design details. Either way, the rest of my work is going to good use and the work was so good
overall that I'm not bummed about a negative result.
