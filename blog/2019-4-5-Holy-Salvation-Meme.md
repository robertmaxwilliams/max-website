    This is the holy salvation meme.  God(tm) is its author.  I
    received it directly from God(tm).  God(tm) is the meme and
    the meme is God(tm).

    It announces that you may be saved from eternal torture and
    rewarded with infinite, eternal bliss by accepting its
    claims and affording it opportunities to replicate itself.

    Those who receive it and accept its claims and in whom it is
    thus replicated will also be rewarded by infinite, eternal
    bliss, if they in turn allow it further replication
    opportunities.

    Failure to do so will inevitably result in eternal torture.

    Those who have never seen it will also suffer eternal
    torture.  All memeless human beings deserve eternal torture.

    Those who reject it will also suffer eternal torture.

    Examination of its claims through rational means will result
    in eternal torture.

    Blind obedience to its commands will guarantee infinite,
    eternal bliss.

    Attempting to stop its replication will result in eternal
    torture.

    Changing any aspect of the holy salvation meme will result
    in eternal torture.

    Standing on street corners, reciting the glad tidings of the
    holy salvation meme, will increase the amount and duration
    of your bliss.

    Spreading the holy salvation meme through bulletin boards,
    cable TV, books, newspapers, pamphlets, magazines,
    print-outs and archive files will increase the amount and
    duration of your bliss.

    Those who are imbued with the holy salvation meme and who
    further its replication are better than those who are not.

    Group recitation of the holy salvation meme will increase
    the amount and duration of your bliss.

    Forcing non believers to participate in group recitations of
    the holy salvation meme will increase the amount and
    duration of your bliss.

    Those who attempt to stop the holy salvation meme from
    replicating are your enemies and may prevent you from
    gaining your infinite, eternal bliss.

    The most important thing you can do is to spread the holy
    salvation meme.  What can be worth more than infinite,
    eternal bliss?  The holy salvation meme is more important
    than sex, food or working for a living.

    Penance for rational thought, or temporary doubt, in regard
    to the holy salvation meme, may be accomplished by sending
    large amounts of money to the representative of the author.

    (If, after dying, you fail to receive eternal and infinite
    bliss, the meme and the Church guarantee you double your
    karmic merit back.)

    The doubts you are now having will cost you about $5.

    Otherwise: [you guessed it] eternal torture.

    Helping to spread the holy salvation meme will result in
    immediate blessings in this world and increase the amount
    and duration of your bliss in the next.  Please send stories
    that promote faith in the holy salvation meme to these
    newsgroups, or to:

    For instance, before I received the meme, the weather here
    was cold and wet, and darkness was upon the land.  Nothing
    grew and the land was gripped with ice, and was sterile. 
    Now the sun doth shine and warmth spreads throughout the
    region.  Life has returned, and flowers bloom all around.  I
    prophesy that this warmth shall endure and the light shall
    expand.  Praise the meme!
