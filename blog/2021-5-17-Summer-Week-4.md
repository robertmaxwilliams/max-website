title: Summer Week 4
---

The first full week of Summer, and I'm finally getting some work done on improving my website. As
much as I like the retro look, I think I'm going to do some style updates, while keeping my
anti-spa ethos in tact.

- Monday:
    - 10-12:30: Prepared another batch of rye, improved website security, took a backup, started on
      website improvements
    - 12:30-2: Continued website improvements
- Tuesday: ???, had errands in the evening
- Wednesday: Went to mom's, taught her how to make soap
- Thursday: Not a work day, managing appointments and so on
- Friday: Cleaning bathroom, cleaning sheets

# Monday

I feel refreshed today, and I feel like working. I also feel like laying around being anxious about
nothing. I guess I can do both. Part of me wants to just work and work and work but moderation is
key to long term productivity (ha, produtivity...), so I'll take a lunch break, then come back and
work another two hours before signing off and doing something non-work stuff.

Oops I skipped lunch.

I'm having trouble getting my website to run locally, I set up my emacs/slime/sbcl stack locally to
run it interactively. I am also learning emacs for real this time, using a video. I might be able to
obtain dual user status - emacs *and* vim. But it'll cost me. I think it's worth it though - lisp
interaction modes in emacs are excellent, and vim mode is clunky. I think the main thing holding me
back before was lacking a full keyboard, but now I have that so it's time to learn emacs.

Anyway I skipped lunch so I'm quitting at 2 today, I'll be back at it tomorrow.

# Epilogue

I didn't get back at it tomorrow, I had a lot going on this week and I felt better not adding my
structured work on top of it. With my project in Bloomington starting week after next, I think it's
best to leave next week (week 5) unstructured since we'll be working in a structured way for the
next month.
