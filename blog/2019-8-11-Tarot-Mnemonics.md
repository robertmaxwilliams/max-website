title: Tarot Card Reading Mnemonics
---

Tarot card decks have two kinds of cards: the Minor Arcana, which are almost exactly the same as a
regular deck of cards, with cards like "5 of spades" or "ace of cups", and Major Arcana, which more
meaningful cards like "The Devil" or "Death" (bet you can't guess what that one means). Major Arcana
are very easy to memorize, even the ones with weird or indirect meanings make their own mnemonic
with how symbolic they are. For example, "The Moon" represents mystery, intuitive abilities, and
deception. Those aren't exactly moon-like traits, but if you just remember "the moon is spoooooky"
then you'll remember the basic idea. The meaning of the cards is basically B.S. anyway, but the
whole point of the cards is to generate B.S. content to overlay a meaningful story onto. The Minor
Arcana are the real trouble to remember. Not only are names not inherently meaningful, the meanings
assigned to them are much more wishy-washy, like "youth" or "fulfillment". 

I'm not sure how to best make these mnemonics. Stringing them all into one big sentence might work.
Method of loci is promising, but takes soooo much effort. It's a good tool so maybe I should just do
it that way instead of trying to do something tricky. Finding a place in my head with 14 distinct
places to put things will be hard, as well as nailing down the "meanings" into tangible objects to
store in those places. My kitchen might have enough spots.

Pentacles/coins/earth/East
<br>
all relate to material things and wealth

+ 1.  Prosperity - The inside of the fridge has been replaced with a tiny kingdom, full of riches
      and gold, in a time of prosperity.
+ 2.  Balance - in the freezer us a bunch of green beans stacked on top of eachother, perfectly
      balanced, as all things should be.
+ 3.  Teamwork - Peanut butter and jelly are on top of the fridge. What a good team. Without the
      other, one would be nothing. Together, they make the dream work. Dream of PB&J.
+ 4.  Budgeting - my budget allows for 4 cans. exactly 4, no more no less. That's what's in here.
+ 5.  Poverty - there are cookbook in here like "101 Ways to Prepare Sewer Rats" and "Dumpster
      Diving for Dummies". These are rough times.
+ 6.  Charity/giving - in the pan is an orphan boy, asking "can I have some more, please?". Too bad
      there is no more!
+ 7.  Making Investments - In the oven is a huge pot of coal. After a few more eons in there, it
      should be diamond! What a good investment.
+ 8.  Patience - There are dozens of pieces of ginger, all of which need to be minced. This is going
      to take a lot of patience.
+ 9.  Indpendent Wealth - There are cookies in the toaster over. From store-bought dough. My mom
      would never approve, but that's the whole point of makin' it on my own. Cookies from a tube
      every day!
+ 10. Culmination - There's a tiny cow in here. Every day I collect a drop of milk from it, and the
      culmination of my work will be enough butter to put in the dish. Then where will the cow go?
      Hmm...
+ Pg. Begginer/New Job - There's a tiny dishboy in the sink, cleaning dishes. The "clean" dishes
      look terrible, pans with eggs burnt to the bottoms. He must be an absolute beginner.
+ Kn. Routine - Instead of regular cutlery, there's a toothbrush and toothpaste and some toast. A
      good morning routine, that one.
+ Qu. Abundance/Creativity - There's an over abundance of buns in here - dancing. A bun dance! Ha!
+ Ki. Security - After letting off the steam of the pressure cooker, I find a little safe. It's so
      tiny but the heavy, it's a really secure safe.



Wands/staves/fire/South
<br>
all relate to spiritual and mental changes

+ 1.  Inspration - In the fridge is an inspirational meme format. "All of the bodies in Mt. Everest
      were once extremely motivated people" or some drivel like that.
+ 2.  Choice - In the freezer is a forked path. You can see it but have not idea how that fits in
      the freezer. Which path do you choose?
+ 3.  Foresight - On top of the fidge there is a spyglass, you can see into the future! Look at
      yourself, reading the next card! And past that - oh god why is there so much blood in the
      future? Weird.
+ 4.  Community - In the can drawer you find a community of ants. They work together, and sit around
      the town square (a can of beans) and ant about their good community values, like finding corn.
+ 5.  Conflict - In the cookbook cabnit, you find two books, one red and one blue. They propose
      directly oppsosing views on the correct way to eat cereal, and the very books themself seem to
      be in physical conflict being so close.
+ 6.  Recognition - In the pan is an award that says "best pan award". Finally, the pan is being
      recognized for its good deeds! Too bad the laquer is burning since the burner is on.
+ 7.  Standing your ground - In the oven is ten armies. You ask them to leave, since its getting
      hot, but the general runs up and says "WE WILL STAND OUR GROUND". "Okay" you say and close the
      door.
+ 8.  Travel/news - On the cutting board it a newspaper. Easy. Also, this newpaper anounces YOUR OWN
      DEATH. You must now travel to the realm of the dead.
+ 9.  Resilience - There is a wax figure 9 in the toaster oven, but it isn't melting. Some
      supernatural force must be making it extra resilient. You hear a far off voice saying "number
      nine... number nine...".
+ 10. Burden - The butter dish is on top of a tiny Atlas, holding it up. What a burden for no gain.
+ Pg. Enthusiasm - In the sink is an enthusiastic clown, so happy to be living in the sink. Horray,
      I guess.
+ Kn. Passion - In the cutlery drawer is a passion fruit. A living passion fruit, so passionate
      about being eaten. It keeps telling you about its goal of being eaten and how excited it is to
      be eaten.
+ Qu. Vibrancy - In the microwave is a brilliant light, like a star. Oh no, someone left tin foil in
      the microwave again. Scary! But so brilliant and pretty.
+ Ki. Vision - In the pressure cooker is a CEO, with great vision. "Hey kid," they say, "you stay in
      there, we're going great places togther". Do you close the lid?
