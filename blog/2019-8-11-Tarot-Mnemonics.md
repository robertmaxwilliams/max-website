title: Tarot Card Reading Nmonics
---

Tarot card decks have two kinds of cards: the Minor Arcana, which are almost exactly the same as a
regular deck of cards, with cards like "5 of spades" or "ace of cups", and Major Arcana, which more
meaningful cards like "The Devil" or "Death" (bet you can't guess what that one means). Major Arcana
are very easy to memorize, even the ones with weird or indirect meanings make their own mnemonic
with how symbolic they are. For example, "The Moon" represents mystery, intuitive abilities, and
deception. Those aren't exactly moon-like traits, but if you just remember "the moon is spoooooky"
then you'll remember the basic idea. The meaning of the cards is basically B.S. anyway, but the
whole point of the cards is to generate B.S. content to overlay a meaningful story onto. The Minor
Arcana are the real trouble to remember. Not only are names not inherently meaningful, the meanings
assigned to them are much more wishy-washy, like "youth" or "fulfillment". 

I'm not sure how to best make these mnemonics. Stringing them all into one big sentence might work.
Method of loci is promising, but takes soooo much effort. It's a good tool so maybe I should just do
it that way instead of trying to do something tricky. Finding a place in my head with 14 distinct
places to put things will be hard, as well as nailing down the "meanings" into tangible objects to
store in those places. My kitchen might have enough spots.
