<h2>Representing Strings</h2>

<p>How can we represent a string in a way that's robust and useful in the dynamic regulation
paradigm? The letters are easy to store in an atom - that just takes one byte. You could even 
store a few letters in one letter atom, no trouble. But lets say we want 256 length strings, 
what then? We could have them all lined up like ducks in a row, but if they get scrambled then
the string is damaged. And that's not easy to move around. So each letter in the string gets 
its own atom, and that atom stores that letter as a byte and the letter's position as another
byte. For example, the string "Hello" converts to:
<ul>
	<li> ('H', 0)
	<li> ('e', 1)
	<li> ('l', 2)
	<li> ('l', 3)
	<li> ('o', 4)
</ul>

<p>Now the string can get shuffled around all you want, no trouble. But what if you have 
multiple strings? It'd be easy to get them mixed up. So let's give each string a random 
identifier. A byte is probably enough. Now if we have two strings:

<ul>
	<li> (54, 'H', 0)
	<li> (54, 'e', 1)
	<li> (54, 'l', 2)
	<li> (54, 'l', 3)
	<li> (54, 'o', 4)
	<li> (39, 'B', 0)
	<li> (39, 'y', 1)
	<li> (39, 'e', 2)
</ul>

<p>We can shuffle them around all we want and still easily recover "Hello" and "Bye" as two different strings.
If an atom goes missing or gets corrupted, then only one letter is missing and the rest of the string if fine.

<h2>Robustification by Duplication</h2>

<p>If we make many copies of each atom of a string, the odds of losing too many letters is reduced. This is what I 
designed my "string isolator" for: it "imprints" on the ID of the first string atom it encounters and then goes around
creating copies of any string atom with that ID (consuming res in the process) and destroys any other string atoms (creating res).

<p>I made another atom type, "string copier", that assigns itself a unique ID when created, imprints on the ID of the
first string that it encounters, and starts attempting to make a copy of the string with a different ID, making a new string with
the same contents as the original.
