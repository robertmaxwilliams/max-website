title: Living Computation Concepts
---

In reading David Ackley's work and thinking about and implementing these ideas, 
a few concepts have really stuck with me as significant.

<h2>Bespoke physics for living computation</h2>

<p>This is really the idea that got me interested in this in the first place. We know
intelligent life is possible, but the amount of matter it takes to make living things
and the incredible scale of time it took to evolve them is disheartening for the
would-be life creator. But what if we knew an environment that was rich with life
that was not only robust to environmental changes but also useful for computation.

<h2>Surviving in a corosive digital environment</h2>

<p>Once I added dreg and gamma rays to my simulatation, I knew what a corrosive
digital environment looked like and I could design for it. There are different
kinds of persistent structures, but all of them rely on distributing
information so it can be recovered when the structure is lost.

<h2>Hide and Heal</h2>

<p>Just by adding a check to my simulator that resets atoms with invalid
IDs, suddenly the effects of simulated bit flips errors was greatly mitigated. On 
a normal computer, blanking any data structure that has an invalid key would not
only be insane, it would make programming almost impossible. A robust program,
though, has no trouble with this because atoms go missing all the time.

<p>One thing I have yet to see is the importance of indefinite scalability. Perhaps once
my computational needs exceed what I can simulate on just my one computer I'll start
looking at ways to connect computers by conventional means.
