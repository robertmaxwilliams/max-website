title: Artificial Intelligence Safety And Security Independent Study Week 2
---

Last week was a good start, and our exploration rate was fairly high. This week we are starting with
a review of AI safety literature, which will serve as a reference for the rest of the semester. We
will address shortcomings in this paper and find relavent recent developments that were not around
at the time of writing.
