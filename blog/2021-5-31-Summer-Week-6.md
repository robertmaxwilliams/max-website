title: Summer Week 6
---

I just moved to Bloomington to work on [secret project] with Luke and Charlie. I only got my computer
set up today (Thursday) but now I should have daily work day blogs. We're working more than 4 hours
per day, but we also have socializing etc in there so it's about the same true work load as my 4
hour days. I don't think we'll be doing a weekend Wednesday either since project only goes on for a
month and we'll get more coherence this way.

# Thursday

We finally got a voice call to work over WebRTC! It turns out you have to run it on two different
computers otherwise it never works - but now that's solved and we're a step closer to having a
working app.

Now Luke is getting the app on a new Linode and Charlie and I are both working on the two player
visual interactive board things.

Oh, I also crammed the last 5 weeks into one blog post, since they were pretty scattered and
inconsistent due to me doing lots of non-computer stuff most of the time.

# Friday

We did it! We have a minimum working product, and next week will be a lot more fun because we'll be
doing graphics stuff. Check it out at <splashcall.com>!
