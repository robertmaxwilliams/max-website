title: My Paper Got Media Attention!
---


I published the optical illusions paper, and got lots of interesting media attention. This is really 
motivating, I feel a lot of imposter syndrome but really I should feel proud that this went so well.

I also fixed some of the more obnoxious typos, but unfortunately didn't end up fixing the irrelevant 
introduction sentence. Next time I will spend more time consulting my peers on style.

I compiled a list of all the place my article ended up:

It's on this page too! Seems to be a daily index of academic papers?

They misquote me several times, I'm not really sure what's going on here.

never ever do this. Having a browser extension to disable javascript comes in handy all too often.
