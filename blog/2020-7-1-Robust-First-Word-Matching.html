title: Robust First String Matching 
---

<p>Since writing the last post I've made a lot of new operations on string -
reversal, eqality testing, splitting on spaces. I've learned two things:
operating on a string without knowing its length requires way too long and
risks truncating the string, and waiting around for the i'th element of a
string to diffuse into the right place takes far too long. To correct this,
I've added length to strings (which might have been a mistake because it
complicates things greately) and I've come up with a "frozen string", which is
just a string that doesn't move where letters that are adjacent to each other
in the original string are adjacent in physical space. This makes some
operations much faster but feels like it isn't in the spirit of robust first,
as these kinds of systems, especially when length is added into the picture,
are not robust to losing letters. 

<p>So I'm trashing all that hard work (but not the lessons I've learned along
the way) to build the first iteration of my simple scripting language that
operates entirely within my simulator, which needs a name. 

<h2>The language</h2>

<p>This thing is going to be extremely basic and procedural, and doesn't even
get a name. It can only store these "strings" and has a limited set of
operators and no way to compose them or define procedures or functions. In the
future, numerical types and function definition will be added somehow but yet.
This thing is going to be so basic as to be basically useless, for a good
reason.  This stuff is <em>hard</em>.

<p>This version will only have two commands: <code>store</code> and
<code>retrieve</code>. <code>store</code> is called with two arguments: an
identifier under which to store, and the string to be stored. It looks like
this: <code>store foo "some string"</code>. <code>retrieve</code> takes one
argument, an identifier, and goes out, copies it, and brings it to a specific
location.

<h2>The Implementation</h2>

<p>A string comes in and everything before the first space is extracted and 
matched against "store" and "retrieve". Here's the first draft of this machine,
which only copies the string and checks it against "store" and retrieve". The
checkers remain in their yellow "maybe" state until a mismatched letter comes in, upon which they
change to a red "no".

<p>Once this machine was working, it needed to be improved by adding first word extraction and a way
to channel the rest of the string to different machines depending on what the first word matched.

<p> First word extraction has an elegant fast solution, where the workers find the lowest space character and destroy everything
after it. Getting the rest of the word is more difficult, since its indices need to be shifted correctly.
